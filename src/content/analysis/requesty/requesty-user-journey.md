![img.png](img.png)# Requesty.ai User Journey: Path to Adoption

## Journey Overview
The path to Requesty adoption typically spans 7-30 days from initial awareness to production deployment. The journey is often triggered by a specific pain point (cost shock, outage, or compliance issue) and accelerated by the platform's free credits and straightforward integration.

## Stage 1: Pain Point Emergence (Day 0-3)

### Triggering Events
- **The Monthly Bill Shock**: Finance forwards the AI invoice - "We spent HOW MUCH on OpenAI last month?"
- **The Critical Outage**: ChatGPT goes down during a customer demo or product launch
- **The Compliance Audit**: Security team discovers ungoverned AI usage across teams
- **The Scaling Crisis**: AI costs growing faster than revenue
- **The Team Chaos**: Discovery that 10 developers have 10 different API keys with no coordination

### User State of Mind
- Stressed about unpredictable costs
- Frustrated with provider dependencies
- Worried about compliance issues
- Overwhelmed by management complexity
- Seeking immediate solutions

### Initial Actions
- Emergency team meeting about AI costs
- Googling "reduce LLM costs" or "OpenAI alternatives"
- Asking CTOs/VPs at other companies how they manage AI
- Reading postmortems about AI outages
- Reviewing internal AI usage (often discovering surprises)

### Key Questions
- "How do other companies manage AI costs at scale?"
- "Can we prevent AI outages from affecting our product?"
- "How do we control who uses which models?"
- "Is there a way to see all our AI usage in one place?"
- "Should we build or buy a solution?"

## Stage 2: Solution Research (Day 3-7)

### Research Approach
- **Technical Investigation**: Engineering team researches AI gateways
- **Vendor Comparison**: Creating spreadsheets comparing options
- **Community Inquiry**: Asking in Slack communities, forums
- **Blog Reading**: "How Company X Cut Their LLM Costs by 80%"
- **Demo Requests**: Scheduling calls with various vendors

### Discovery Channels
- Organic search for "LLM gateway" or "AI router"
- Community recommendations in engineering forums
- Vendor comparison sites and reviews
- Technical blog posts about AI cost optimization
- Referrals from other engineering teams

### Requesty Discovery
- Finding Requesty in search results or comparisons
- Attracted by "40% cost reduction" claims
- Noticing the simple, transparent pricing model
- Reading about user-level controls (not just API keys)
- Appreciating the bootstrapped, customer-focused approach

### Initial Evaluation
- Reviewing the model catalog (300+ models)
- Understanding the 5% pricing model
- Checking enterprise features (SAML SSO, compliance)
- Reading documentation quality
- Assessing integration complexity

### Alternatives Considered
- Building in-house routing solution
- Other gateways (Portkey, OpenRouter, Kong)
- Direct multi-provider integration
- Staying with status quo (and accepting issues)
- Open source solutions

## Stage 3: Technical Validation (Day 7-10)

### Proof of Concept Planning
- Identifying a test project or team
- Setting success criteria (cost, reliability, performance)
- Allocating engineering resources
- Getting buy-in from stakeholders
- Planning rollback strategy

### Initial Setup
- **Sign-Up**: Creating account at Requesty dashboard
- **Credits**: Using $6 free credits for testing
- **API Key**: Generating first API key
- **Integration**: Updating base URL in code (often < 1 hour)
- **Testing**: Running first requests through Requesty

### Technical Discoveries
```python
# Their existing code
client = OpenAI(api_key=OPENAI_KEY)

# Becomes this simple change
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.requesty.ai/v1",
    api_key=REQUESTY_KEY
)
```

### "Aha!" Moments
- "We can see exactly who's using what in real-time"
- "It automatically failed over when OpenAI was down"
- "Setting user budgets is exactly what we needed"
- "The integration literally took 30 minutes"
- "We can use models we couldn't access before"

### Performance Testing
- Comparing latency (discovering <50ms overhead)

## Summary

The Requesty adoption journey is characterized by its problem-driven nature and pragmatic progression. Unlike exploratory technology adoption, Requesty users typically arrive with a specific, urgent pain point that needs immediate resolution. The journey from pain to production can be remarkably fast when the problem is acute and the organization is agile.

The key to Requesty's successful adoption is the combination of solving a real, measurable problem (cost and reliability) with minimal friction (simple integration, transparent pricing). Users quickly see value through immediate cost visibility and savings, which creates momentum for broader adoption. The responsive support team and customer-focused approach turn users into advocates, driving organic growth through referrals and success stories.

Most importantly, Requesty users don't just adopt a tool—they gain control over their AI infrastructure, transforming a source of stress and uncertainty into a predictable, manageable part of their technology stack.
