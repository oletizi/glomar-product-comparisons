# Requesty.ai Value Proposition

## Core Value Proposition

Requesty is a unified LLM platform designed to simplify how you access, manage, and optimize your large language model usage. It acts as an intelligent gateway that routes requests to the best LLM for your task, while providing logging, cost management, and analytics out-of-the-box. By connecting to multiple LLM providers through a single API, Requesty directly addresses challenges like cost control, reliability, and performance variability inherent in leveraging diverse AI models.

## Key Benefits

### 1. Intelligent LLM Routing
Requesty automatically analyzes your request and routes it to the most suitable model based on factors like task type, performance data, and cost efficiency. This ensures optimal results for every query without manual model selection. The system intelligently:
- Classifies incoming prompts (coding, analysis, creative text)
- Dispatches them to the model optimized for that category
- Balances performance and cost effectively
- Adapts routing based on real-time model performance

### 2. Cost Optimization & Control
Requesty's intelligent routing has been a game-changer for AI stacks, with users reporting 40-80% cost reductions while maintaining response quality. Key cost features include:
- User-based spending limits (not just API key limits)
- Real-time cost analytics and alerts
- Intelligent caching to minimize redundant requests
- Automatic routing to cheaper models when appropriate
- Transparent pricing: base provider costs + 5% Requesty fee

### 3. Enterprise-Grade Reliability
Advanced routing and fallback mechanisms keep AI applications online when other services fail. Requesty provides:
- Multi-provider redundancy with automatic failover
- <50ms switching time between providers
- 99.99% uptime SLA
- Intelligent queuing with exponential backoff
- Real-time health monitoring of all providers

### 4. Team Management & Governance
Requesty offers comprehensive team management features that set it apart from simple gateways:
- **Individual Budgets**: Set spending limits per user (e.g., $100/month for Sarah, $50 for Jake)
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Admins see everything, developers see only their data
- **SAML SSO Integration**: Okta live, Azure AD coming soon
- **Approved Models**: Pre-approved model lists based on compliance requirements
- **Compliance Tracking**: SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR compliance status for all providers

### 5. Developer Experience
Stop wasting time with multiple LLM APIs and provider requirements. One API to rule them all:
- OpenAI-compatible API for easy migration
- Consistent JSON responses across all models with automatic validation
- Real-time token streaming for faster responses
- Support for vision, tool use, and model-specific capabilities
- $6 free credits to test the platform

## Technical Architecture
