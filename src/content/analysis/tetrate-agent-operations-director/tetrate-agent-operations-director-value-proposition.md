# Tetrate Agent Operations Director Value Proposition

## Core Value Proposition

Tetrate Agent Operations Director provides GenAI runtime visibility and governance to maximize ROI and ensure compliance
for enterprise AI initiatives. Built on the battle-tested Envoy AI Gateway, it enables organizations to discover,
monitor, and control all AI usage across the enterprise without disrupting application development—transforming "Shadow
AI" from a risk into a managed, optimized asset.

## Key Benefits

### 1. Frictionless Discovery of AI Usage

Agent Operations Director passively discovers and inventories all GenAI traffic without requiring changes to
applications:

- Discovery Gateways deployed at network perimeter
- Passive interception and inventory of inference transactions
- Automatic metadata aggregation and presentation
- Zero dependency on application development teams
- Real-time, continuously updated global source of truth

### 2. Comprehensive Visibility & Analytics

Transform opaque AI usage into actionable insights:

- Map discovered AI transactions to owners (teams, applications, or custom constructs)
- Analyze usage trends and cost drivers by owner or provider
- Identify historical usage patterns and spending trends
- Real-time visibility into resource consumption per application
- Tie AI usage to organizational ownership structures

### 3. Intelligent Governance & Control

Move from monitoring to active governance with powerful controls:

- **Budget Management**: Set and enforce spending limits at team/application level
- **Rate Limiting**: Control usage by tokens or financial measures
- **Sanctioned Models**: Block unsanctioned model usage automatically
- **Guardrails**: Deploy pre-built or custom guardrails based on FINOS and NIST frameworks
- **PII Protection**: Prevent credential or sensitive data exfiltration

### 4. Cost Optimization & ROI Maximization

Drive measurable returns from AI investments:

- Identify and eliminate wasteful spending on Shadow AI
- Substitute expensive models with cheaper alternatives without degradation
- Observe factors driving GenAI costs
- Provide fallback options to avoid service interruption during outages
