# Tetrate Agent Router Service User Journey: Path to Adoption

## Journey Overview
The path to TARS adoption typically spans 30-90 days from initial awareness to production deployment, though rapid adopters can move from discovery to initial use within hours thanks to the low-friction onboarding.

## Stage 1: Problem Recognition (Week 0-2)

### Triggering Events
- **Cost Shock**: Monthly AI bill exceeds budget or shows exponential growth
- **Reliability Crisis**: Production AI application fails due to model provider outage
- **Compliance Mandate**: Security/legal team requires governance for AI usage
- **Scaling Challenge**: Need to support multiple teams using different AI models
- **Development Bottleneck**: Developers complaining about managing multiple API keys and providers

### User State of Mind
- Frustrated with current complexity
- Anxious about costs or reliability
- Pressure from management to "figure out AI"
- Overwhelmed by infrastructure requirements
- Seeking better way to manage AI workloads

### Actions Taken
- Googling "LLM cost optimization," "AI model routing," "OpenAI alternatives"
- Asking peers in Slack communities or LinkedIn about their AI infrastructure
- Reading blog posts about AI operations and best practices
- Attending webinars on AI governance or cost management
- Internal discussions about build vs. buy

### Key Questions
- "How are other companies managing multiple AI models?"
- "Is there a way to avoid vendor lock-in?"
- "Can we control AI costs without limiting innovation?"
- "How do we ensure AI reliability for production apps?"

## Stage 2: Solution Discovery (Week 2-3)
