# Two Paths to AI Excellence: Development vs. Governance

Tetrate offers two complementary solutions for different AI challenges. While both are built on proven Envoy technology,
they serve distinct needs: Agent Router Service empowers developers with intelligent routing, while Agent Operations
Director provides enterprise-wide governance and visibility.

## Quick Comparison

### Tetrate Agent Router Service

**Best for:** Developers and teams who need reliable, cost-effective access to AI models with intelligent routing and
seamless integration with coding tools.

✓ Instant sign-up with $10 free credits  
✓ Native integration with Cline, Goose, and agentic tools  
✓ Advanced playground for prompt engineering  
✓ Context-aware routing for cost optimization  
✓ OpenAI-compatible API for easy migration

### Tetrate Agent Operations Director

**Best for:** Enterprises requiring comprehensive visibility and governance over all AI usage across the organization,
especially in regulated industries.

✓ Passive discovery of all AI traffic without app changes  
✓ Real-time cost tracking and budget enforcement  
✓ FINOS and NIST-aligned governance frameworks  
✓ Shadow AI detection and control  
✓ Enterprise-scale architecture for thousands of apps

## Understanding the Relationship

**These products work together**: Agent Router Service handles the "how" of AI routing, while Agent Operations Director
manages the "who, what, and why" of AI governance. Many enterprises deploy both—Router Service for developer
productivity and Operations Director for organizational control.

## Key Differentiators

### 🎯 Target Users & Use Cases

**Tetrate Agent Router Service** is designed for developers and development teams actively building with AI. Whether
you're using Cline for AI-powered coding, building chatbots, or iterating on prompts, Router Service provides the
reliable, cost-optimized routing you need. It's the tool developers reach for when they need their AI to just work—with
automatic failover, intelligent model selection, and seamless integration with their existing workflow.

**Tetrate Agent Operations Director** addresses the enterprise governance challenge. When the CFO asks "Why did we
spend $500K on AI last quarter?" or the CISO discovers sensitive data going to ChatGPT, Operations Director provides
answers and control. It's built for platform teams, FinOps, security officers, and executives who need to see and govern
all AI usage across the organization.

*Choose Router Service if:* You're building with AI and need reliable, cost-effective access to models.  
*Choose Operations Director if:* You need to discover, monitor, and govern enterprise-wide AI usage.

### 💰 Cost Model & ROI

**Tetrate Agent Router Service** operates on a simple, transparent model: 5% fee on provider costs. The intelligent
routing typically saves 20-40% on AI costs through context-aware model selection, making the net savings substantial.
With $5 free credits, developers can start immediately and see value from day one. ROI comes from reduced costs and
improved reliability.

**Tetrate Agent Operations Director** is an enterprise platform with pricing appropriate for organization-wide
governance. The ROI comes from discovering Shadow AI (often 3x more usage than expected), preventing compliance
violations, and optimizing spending across all teams. Organizations typically see 30-40% cost reduction while gaining
complete visibility and control.

*Choose Router Service if:* You want simple, usage-based pricing with immediate cost savings.  
*Choose Operations Director if:* You need to control millions in AI spending across your enterprise.

### 🔍 Visibility & Control

**Tetrate Agent Router Service** provides detailed observability for your API calls—see costs, latency, model
performance, and usage patterns for applications using the Router Service. The advanced playground enables side-by-side
model comparison and prompt optimization. You have complete control over routing strategies and model selection for your
traffic.

**Tetrate Agent Operations Director** discovers ALL AI traffic across your organization—not just what goes through
Tetrate. Using passive discovery at the network perimeter, it finds Shadow AI, maps it to owners, and provides
enterprise-wide analytics. You can enforce budgets, block unsanctioned models, and implement guardrails based on
FINOS/NIST frameworks across every team and application.

*Choose Router Service if:* You need observability for your AI applications and development.  
*Choose Operations Director if:* You need to see and control all AI usage across your enterprise.

### 🚀 Implementation & Time to Value

**Tetrate Agent Router Service** offers instant gratification—sign up, get your API key, and start routing in under 5
minutes. Change one line of code (the base URL) and you're using Tetrate. The playground is immediately available for
prompt engineering. Same-day production deployment is common for individual developers and small teams.

**Tetrate Agent Operations Director** requires enterprise deployment at network perimeters but discovers AI usage
without any application changes. The Discovery Gateway passively intercepts traffic, meaning you see Shadow AI within
days. Full governance implementation typically takes 30-90 days as you map ownership, set budgets, and implement
policies across the organization.

*Choose Router Service if:* You need immediate access to reliable AI routing.  
*Choose Operations Director if:* You're solving an enterprise-wide governance challenge.

### 🛡️ Governance & Compliance

**Tetrate Agent Router Service** provides governance through intelligent routing—ensuring sensitive requests go to
appropriate models, implementing fallbacks for reliability, and maintaining audit trails for your API usage. It's
governance at the application level, perfect for teams that need control without enterprise complexity.

**Tetrate Agent Operations Director** implements comprehensive enterprise governance aligned with FINOS and NIST
frameworks. It enforces budgets at team/department levels, implements pre-built or custom guardrails, prevents PII
exfiltration, ensures only sanctioned models are used, and provides compliance reporting for auditors. It's governance
at the organizational level.

*Choose Router Service if:* You need application-level governance and compliance.  
*Choose Operations Director if:* You're in a regulated industry requiring enterprise governance.

## Use Case Recommendations

### For Individual Developers & Small Teams

**Recommended: Agent Router Service**  
Instant access, simple pricing, and powerful routing make it perfect for building AI applications.

### For Agentic Coding (Cline, Goose, Cursor)

**Recommended: Agent Router Service**  
Native integrations and context-aware routing optimize your AI coding workflow.

### For Shadow AI Discovery

**Recommended: Agent Operations Director**  
Only Operations Director can passively discover all AI usage across your enterprise.

## Common Deployment Patterns

### Pattern 1: Developer-First

Start with Agent Router Service for development teams, add Operations Director as AI usage scales and governance becomes
critical.

### Pattern 2: Governance-First

Deploy Operations Director to discover and control Shadow AI, then provide Router Service as the sanctioned path for
developers.

### Pattern 3: Comprehensive Platform

Deploy both simultaneously—Operations Director for visibility and governance, Router Service for optimized development.
